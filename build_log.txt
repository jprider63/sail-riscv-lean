  LeanRV64D.Functions.currentlyEnabled
with errors
failed to infer structural recursion:
Cannot use parameter merge_var:
  the type extension does not have a `.brecOn` recursor


failed to prove termination, possible solutions:
  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the remaining goals
  - Use `termination_by` to specify a different well-founded relation
  - Use `decreasing_by` to specify your own tactic for discharging this kind of goal
